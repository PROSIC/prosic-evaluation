For concordance analysis, we ran varlociraptor and the other callers on four independent sequencings of the same tumor/normal pair.
Called variants were matched against each other, yielding a graph. Connected components in this graph of more than one node we counted as concordant calls.
Left plot shows concordance vs minimum allele frequency. Right plot shows number of calls vs minimum allele frequency.
The grey lines depict the theoretical expectation according to the model of neutral tumor evolution by Williams et al.
